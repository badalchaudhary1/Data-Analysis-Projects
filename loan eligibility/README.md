# 🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan using classification techniques. It’s based on demographic, financial, and employment-related features of the applicants.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Using a cleaned dataset, we trained a model to classify whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on inputs like gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, and credit history.
