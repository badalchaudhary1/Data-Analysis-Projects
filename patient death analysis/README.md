Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes various health metrics related to heart disease.
It provides key insights into survival rates, the impact of age, smoking habits, and other medical parameters on heart disease outcomes.

ðŸ“Š Key Features
KPIs at a Glance

67.89% â€“ Overall Survival Rate

58.76 â€“ Average Ejection Fraction

203 â€“ Total Patient Count

96 â€“ Survived Patients Count

Visual Analysis

Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group

Shows correlation between survival count and average ejection fraction across different age ranges.

Survival Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group

Highlights how kidney function (serum creatinine levels) varies with survival rates in different age categories.

Survival Rate by Age Group

Line chart depicting the percentage survival rate among different age brackets.

Impact of Smoking

Visualizes how smoking and other conditions (anemia, diabetes, hypertension) are distributed across age groups.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation

Excel / CSV Dataset â€“ Data source for analysis

Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Power Query

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following fields:

Age

Sex

Ejection Fraction

Serum Creatinine

Smoking Status

Survival Status

Other Medical Conditions (Anemia, Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.)

ðŸŽ¯ Insights from the Dashboard
Survival rate decreases significantly in the 71+ age group.

Patients with low ejection fraction and high serum creatinine levels tend to have lower survival chances.

Smoking and comorbidities contribute to a higher mortality rate.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Open the Power BI (.pbix) file.

Connect or replace the dataset if needed.

Explore different visualizations using the interactive filters.
